## This is the lifetime of the session in seconds
session.lifetime:   300
 
## App specific configuration: The service is designed to be used by other
##  apps - ala OAuth2 model - the allowed apps are expected to have a configuration
##  in this folder (relative to current path). See app-config.example for example

bind.pass:      supersekrit

## CASSANDRA Configuration
##  nodes: At least a couple of the cassandra nodes in the cluster. The client
##   retrieves the topology of the cluster from any node which it can connect to
##   so having at least a couple of nodes in the list will guard against node failure.
## This is a comma separated list and it will be turned into a python list by the app
nodes:      IP.host1, IP.host2, IP.host3
